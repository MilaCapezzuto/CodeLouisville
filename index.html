      <h3>About our company</h3>
      <p>Our cheeses are made using old pastoral method and they are aged in cellar on wood boards following the most traditional and ancient Italian procedures.</p>
<p>Since our cheeses are all natural and no processed, they change with the seasons as the temperature and the humidity also changes in our cellar.</p>
<p>We never use wax, preservatives or mold inhibitors of any kind, the mold on our cheese is even wanted as an essential part of the “affinage” which is the aging method that develop of flavors and texture and it can be done only in particular climate condition, with wood board and the “good” cheese mold. The rind of our cheeses are edible and if mold develops during the storage can be scraped off in fact it does not compromise the edibility and for many cheese connoisseurs it’s taste is even appreciated.</p>
